Json Request And Response In Node Js Via Restful Api

- There is an online API called www.jsontest.com 

- There, the request can be made for various services like IP address, Date and Time, validation and also customise the api for our own use.

- The program has been made in Node JS to request for the services available on api.

- The program receives the response in the JSON format of the services we have applied for.

- The program uses GET method to request the server for the services.

- The program receives the JSON data and parse it to string to be able to get output with the function called JSON.parse()




Places i need improvement:-

- Understand more syntax of Node JS

- To be able to implement this feature using other technology like javascript or angular


SOURCE CODE

const https = require('http');

https.get('http://date.jsontest.com/', (resp) => {
  let data = '';

  // A chunk of data has been recieved.
  resp.on('data', (chunk) => {
    data += chunk;
  });

  // The whole response has been received. Print out the result.
  resp.on('end', () => {
    console.log(JSON.parse(data));
  });

}).on("error", (err) => {
  console.log("Error: " + err.message);
});


//resp gets active when there is a successful connection for the request and on('data' stores the data if there is any data available for the response
